# hello-world
my firt repository project on GitHub
my name is jw and this is my first project on GitHub.  I hope I am the right place to start developing a spreadsheet that automatically gets weather forecasts for places we go to kayak and/or backpack.
This readme file is version 1 and is the first branch on the hello-world repository project
